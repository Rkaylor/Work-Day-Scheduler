# Work Day Scheduler

# Description
This day planner allows you to enter tasks during regular business hours. It will also change colors depending on the time of day.

If the text area is Red, that means it's the present time.
If the text area is Gray, it means the time is past.
If the text area is Green, it means the task is upcoming.
Once you're finished organizing your day, click on the checkmark icon to save your task and it should appear the next time you open the page.
